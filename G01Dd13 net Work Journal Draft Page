Slouching toward Bethlehem,
ala Yeats' The Second Coming.<br>
<br>
The Bleak Omniverse gives way to 
repeating patterns and force:<br>
gyres, geothermal circulations and 
journeys around the Sun üåû. <br>
<br>
Gravitropic growth in a world üåé 
of ups and downs.<br>
<br>
The constancy
of gravity has always been
my friend<br>
and now after all this time ‚è≤Ô∏è<br>
<br>
I realize it may have subtleties
of expression at different scalar 
realms (quantum, atomic, molecular, 
biochemical, human, solar and 
cosmological).<br>
<br>
And there may be a 
meter and rhyme at and between each,<br>
waiting to be found.
